Modifications to this work include resolving errors that otherwise result fatal compile using the current version of Arduino IDE

This code can be made more efficient which would be needed were this to be compiled for the ATTINY processors.

## Colophon:

*If you even think of plagiarizing, lifting, or stealing whatsoever part of this document, you will be entering a world of pain! There is a warning written…  I lost my train of thought here…  The warning, as it reads, is that if anyone were to steal a book from this collection, let said book change into a serpent in his hand, and rend him to devastation. May he be struck with paralysis and all his limbs unmade. Allow him to worsen without compassion or respite, until he decays into oblivion. Let Book-worms eat his Entrails as a general-purpose sign. Allow him to live out his life throughout all of these horribilis extensive durations, and when he receives his final punishment in hell or wherever, let the fires burn over him for a very long time and hardly ever stop.* 

However, you may use all or any of this waffle as you see fit.
